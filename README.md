## 🧠 What is HoloMentor?

**HoloMentor** is an agentic educational assistant built to empower developers and learners in the Qubic ecosystem. It acts as a futuristic, conversational AI librarian that helps you:

- Understand C++ smart contract code
- Run AI-powered audits and generate test cases
- Interact with deployed Qubic contracts (using tick-based logic)
- Register and deploy agents using Fetch.ai's Agentverse
- Learn visually via a sci-fi holographic user interface

## 📦 Getting Started

> Setup instructions will be expanded once MVP is running.

### Clone the Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/holomentor.git
cd holomentor



**Install Dependencies**
npm install     # for frontend
# or
pip install -r requirements.txt  # for agent services

**🧪 Deployment Plan**
We will deploy smart contracts to the Qubic Testnet, and agents will run via the uAgents + ASI:One infrastructure.

**Testnet goals:**

✅ Deploy at least 1 working contract (Noor)
✅ Run ExplainAgent and AuditAgent on real uploaded contracts (Nimra)
✅ Visualize explanations and results in a 3D/holo-themed UI (Saad)
