#**🧠 HoloMentor: The Qubic AI Knowledge Guider**
An AI-powered holographic mentor that teaches, audits, and helps you interact with decentralized C++ smart contracts on the Qubic Network using agent-based architecture powered by Fetch.ai, Groq, and ASI:One.

#**🌟 What is HoloMentor?**
HoloMentor is an intelligent, agentic assistant designed to empower developers, auditors, and learners in the blockchain ecosystem.

It acts as a sci-fi librarian that enables users to:

🔍 Understand C++ smart contract code line-by-line

🔐 Audit logic for vulnerabilities and risky patterns

🧪 Generate test cases with AI assistance

🌐 Interact with tick-based Qubic smart contracts

🤖 Deploy and register agents using Fetch.ai uAgents and ASI:One

🧬 Get fast reasoning via Groq + LLaMA

🪩 Experience it all through a futuristic holographic UI

#**🛠️ Core Features**
**Feature	Description**0
🧠 ExplainAgent	Explains uploaded Qubic C++ contracts step-by-step using LLaMA (via Groq)
🛡️ AuditAgent	Analyzes contract logic and identifies common vulnerabilities
🧪 TestAgent	Suggests or generates unit test cases
🌐 Agentverse Registry	ASI:One decentralized agent registration and discovery
📊 Qubic Explorer	Queries tick-based contract states, balances, and metadata
🎮 Sci-Fi UI	Built using React + TailwindCSS for glowing, holographic effects

#**👨‍💻 Tech Stack**
Layer	Stack
Frontend	React, TailwindCSS, Vite
Backend	FastAPI, Python
Agents	Fetch.ai uAgents, ASI:One, Agentverse
AI Models	Groq + LLaMA (primary), OpenAI/Gemini (optional fallback)
Smart Contracts	C++ on Qubic Testnet
Optional	MCP, Coral Protocol, Groq Cloud API

#**🧠 Example Use Case**

✅ Option 1: Direct via Groq + LLaMA
The user uploads a contract via the UI.

Backend FastAPI calls Groq’s LLaMA API directly.

The explanation is rendered in the UI instantly.

✅ Option 2: ExplainAgent via Fetch.ai (uAgents + ASI:One)
User uploads a smart contract via the Holo UI.

Frontend sends it to a local TestAgent, which relays it to ExplainAgent.

ExplainAgent, registered on ASI:One and running with uAgents, receives the contract.

It internally calls the Groq + LLaMA API for explanation.

Response is returned via agent messaging and shown in the UI.

✅ Benefits:
🔗 Connected to ASI:One for decentralized identity

🛡️ Modular, composable, can trigger AuditAgent or TestAgent in a pipeline

🤖 Trust-enhancing multi-agent architecture with end-to-end traceability
